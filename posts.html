										<h6 class="post"><b>Mai 08, 2023 by Acidburn0zzz</b></h6>

<p>Less than one month after the last release we are bringing you a shiny new one - v2.1</p>
<p>We’ve gone all out on this patch release - fixing bugs, adding new features and updating translations.</p>
<p>As always you can find the release on <a href="https://github.com/Acidburn0zzz/gh-webpage/installer/releases/tag/v2.0">our Github releases page</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick rundown of our changes:</p>
<h3 id="translations">Translations</h3>
<p>We’ve updated the English, French translations.</p>
<h3 id="changes-to-packages">Changes to packages</h3>
<p>all as been moved to the AUR, so we currently don’t offer another optional software.</p>
<h3 id="new-features">New features</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>yay</code> was added to custom DE installations</li>
<li>Qtile Window Manager was added as an optional DE/WM</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-notable-features">Other notable features</h3>
<ul>
<li>We’ve cleaned the codebase up quite a bit</li>
<li><code>anarchy -u</code> works properly now - didn’t work because of the new repo url</li>
<li>We’ve completely reinvented the <code>iso-generator</code> script</li>
<li>Logging is now enabled in <code>iso-generator.sh</code> (<code>log/</code> directory)</li>
<li>Generated ISOs are moved to the <code>out/</code> directory</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="docker-support">Docker support</h3>
<p>We're currently working on supporting Docker for generating the Anarchy ISO. You can track my progress in the <a href="https://github.com/Acidburn0zzz/gh-webpage/docker">Acidburn0zzz/gh-webpage/docker</a> repository.</p>
<p>This will also mean some changes to the <code>iso-generator.sh</code> script, such as adding optional arguments, like <code>--no-color</code> and <code>--no-input</code>, with something like <code>--arch-iso</code>, <code>--output-dir</code> and <code>--log-dir</code> planned for the future, to enable custom folders for use with Docker.</p>
<p>That’s pretty much it for this release, you can find the full changelog <a href="https://github.com/Acidburn0zzz/gh-webpage/installer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">here</a>.</p>

                                        <p>Another ArchLinux update, yay, like paru!</p>
                                        <p>2.0’s changelog is actually quite long, despite being a “patch” version.</p>
                                        <p>You can check out the changelog <a href="https://github.com/Acidburn0zzz/gh-webpage/installer/releases/tag/v2.0">on our release page</a> for a summary or continue reading for a more in-depth look into the changes.</p>
                                        <p>Firstly we’ve completely removed the GUI installer, since it was very outdated and it hasn’t been built since like v1.7.a1. AFAIK nobody has complained about the lack of GUI builds, but if enough people would like it back, it can be arranged, although we’d need some maintainers for it. This does not affect the installation of DEs and WMs, you can still choose all the ones you could before, it’s just that the installation takes place in a terminal.</p>
                                        <p>We’ve also refactored the <code>archlinux-creator.sh</code> script to more closely follow bash best practices and we’ve renamed it to <code>iso-generator.sh</code> to make it less confusing, since archlinux-creator and archlinux-installer are similarly named, but do completely different things. Maybe we’ll move the archlinux-installer script to somewhere else at some point.</p>
                                        <p>Something quite important was also added in v2.0: We’ve started generating proper checkums. You should now be able to use sha256sum to check if the image was properly downloaded.</p>
                                        <p><code>arch-wiki(-cli)</code> was also completely removed in this version. To be fair, it was removed in v1.0.4 already, but the menu option still existed and didn’t work, so now it’s finally gone.</p>
                                        <p>For those of you who want to compile your own Archlinux installers, we’ve made the script more verbose, with more helpful info and proper error exits.</p>
                                        <p>French translations were updated, GREP_OPTIONS was removed from .zshrc, OpenJDK7 was replaced by OpenJDK8 in the optional software menu and OpenJDK11 & 12 were added as well. Also in the list of added packages were <code>youtube-dl</code> and <code>openssh</code> (which was added by default to our quick server installations)</p>
                                        <p>The insertion of modules into <code>mkinitcpio.conf</code> was fixed and the issue of LUKS-encryped XFS installations not booting was resolved as well.</p>
                                        <p>On the Github side of things we’ve also updated the README and have added issue and pull request templates - please use them.</p>
                                        <p>A <a href="https://github.com/Acidburn0zzz/gh-webpage/installer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing guide</a> was also added, which can give you some ideas on how to contribute to the project.</p>
                                        <p>Well, that just about sums it up, see you when the next release comes out ;)</p>

                                        <p>Hello,</p>
                                        <p>My name is Erazem and I’m a fairly new contributor to the Anarchy Linux project and the author of this website.</p>
                                        <p>Like (hopefully) most of you reading this, I really like the project and as a beginner in open source I wanted to contribute to it. Since I only know a bit about bash scripting I haven’t been able to contribute much actual code yet, but that didn’t stop me from contributing altogether. And it shouldn’t stop you from contributing either.</p>
                                        <p>If you know how to code in bash that’s great - find <a href="https://github.com/Acidburn0zzz/gh-webpage/installer/issues">an issue</a> you like and help fix it, or even add a feature you’d like to see in Archlinux.</p>
                                        <p>If you don’t know how to code there’s still a bunch of things to do - fix typos in the <a href="https://github.com/Acidburn0zzz/gh-webpage/installer/blob/master/README.md">README</a>, update <a href="https://github.com/Acidburn0zzz/gh-webpage/installer/tree/website-source">the website</a> or help translate the project.</p>
                                        <p>If you can’t see yourself doing any of those things, you can still help us in other ways:</p>
                                        <p>Test the software and report bugs</p>
                                        <p>or</p>
                                        <p>Give us feedback on the project:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Tell us what you like/dislike about the new website design</li>
                                            <li>Tell us what new features you’d like to see in the Anarchy installer</li>
                                            <li>Tell us how we can help you contribute to the project (maybe you just need a mentor)</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>As you can see there really are a lot of things you can do to contribute to this project and we would really appreciate it if you tried doing at least one of them.</p>
                                        <p>Enjoy your experience with Anarchy Linux :)</p>
